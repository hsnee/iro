## Inspiration
taking too long to get dressed every morning was a major inspiration :)

## What it does
Iro is a fully-functional android app that tells you whether 2 colors match together or not based on professionally made color palettes. The app would help people buy clothes with matching colors.

## Challenges I ran into
This was my first time developing for android, and my first time coding in Java.

## What I learned
I learned programming for the android.

## What's next for Iro
There's a lot of enhancements that can be made for the app, e.g. adding more color palettes and supporting more than 2 colors at a time. I also plan to make iro a wearable with a color sensor.

**Fun fact: Iro means color in Japanese and is pronounce "eero"**
